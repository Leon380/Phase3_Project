    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Churn is a major problem for most telecom Company, as it can result in lost revenue and reduced profitability. In this project, I aim to develop a machine learning algorithms to build a model to predict and identify customers who are at risk of churning, and provide recommendations to reduce churn rates. In this project, I am going to use SytiaTel Customer Churn dataset which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/becksddf/churn-in-telecoms-dataset).<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Understanding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer churn is a big problem in any industry and one of the most important concerns for the Telecom industry. The effect on the revenues of the companies, because of this customer churns is huge, especially in the telecom field, that's why these companies are seeking to develop a predictive potential customer churn. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate, and it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, that's why customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer churn is a metric showing when a subscriber or a regular customer cancels his subscription or stops doing business with a company. Churn could be due to various factors, including switching to a competitor for better price offers, cancelling their subscription because of poor customer service, or discontinuing all contact with a brand due to insufficient touch points.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Syriatel is a provider of mobile telecommunication and data services based in Damascus, Syria. It has established that long-term relationships with customers are more effective than trying to attract new customers. Churn prediction has therefore become a very important part of the company's strategy.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Understanding:\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset has 3333 rows and with 21 columns. Churn column is the target variable which has 483 customers who are churners and the remaining 2850 are non-churners. Since the target variable is a categorical variable, classification algorithms are used to build the predictive model. Recall is used to evaluate the model's performance.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives:\n",
    ">>To build a machine learning model that can accurately predict customers who will churn based on the information available in the dataset.<br>\n",
    ">>To identify the features that are important for predicting customer churn.<br>\n",
    ">>To advise SyriaTel on how to retain customers.<br>\n",
